# App Inspiration

While at BrainStation, I was given the challange to build an app in 24h, while also working with another devoploper for the first time. 
We decided to build a weather app, but for MARS! The inspiration came from the new Mars rover, Perseverance, that just landed and somehow incorperating that.

## Technologies Used

React, SASS, and NASA's weather and "photo of the day" API's

### Funcitonality

Phase 1 (Current)
- Every day a new background photo will populate, and the weather status will update

Phase 2
- Store historic data so you can go back to previous days to see the weather and photos for that day
